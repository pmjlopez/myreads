# MyReads Project

## Description
This project allows the user to put books on to three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. The books can be transferred to other shelves or be removed from all shelves. Users can search for books and add them to the shelves.

## Installation
To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* view the application in a browser by going to http://localhost:3000/ or whatever is indicated after running `npm start`

## Important
The Search Page uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Credits
This project was created using the MyReads template at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
